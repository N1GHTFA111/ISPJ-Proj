in the bank, create a new user with role of IT department

for the main developer of the bank
create a iam group
then can add iam users created with your api key to the IT department through the username

so now those users can login with their accounts through the iam portal to the user

the sentinel admin side can see and edit user password


Now i need to make the doucment verification system

when the user export the pdf, metadata contains the public key
the database stores the signature of the original pdf, the private key

when the user upload pdf for verification, metadata extracts public key
use public key to verify the signature in the db

use elliptic curve crypto

#then implement encryption of the signature for the pdf because
# i need my quantum crypto to carry this out using that as the key
# then use aes gcm
