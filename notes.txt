i have 5 roles on the bank site
user (can withdraw, deposit and see news and submit requests)
employee (can see transaction history
IT (like an employee, but account can access the sentinel dashboard)
manager (can only view customer details and change customer details via sentinel dashboard and access evirec, can
can only view employees but cannot change their details, can view transaction stuff)
executive (can view everything and change user accounts)

for logs
developer can see only api key logs
manager and above can see all logs

user lv1
employee lv2
IT lv3
manager lv4
executive lv5

bank website has a user management page (should all be contained in bank app)
employee can only see user
IT (stand for IT) can see only email, username and role of employee and user, can edit their username, email and password only
manager can see lv3 and below details, can only edit employee and developer
senior manager can see lv4 and below, can only edit manager, developer and employee
executive can see all levels, can edit everything but employee

IT, manager, senior manager and executive accounts can access Sentinel


on the bank website
whenever transaction occurs > transaction history updated
employee should only be able to see username, date, amount, type
IT and above should be able to see more since they need to correlate logs

for logs dashboard
those with access should only be able to see the app api key logs

on sentinel there is a file sharing platform
individual employees can only access the page for creating buckets and storing files and sharing

there will be 3 buckets immutable
public, private and confidential
public can access files with no pii (lv2 minimum)
private can access document files like word or pdf with pii (lv3 minimum)
confidential can access trade secret and other files (lv6 minimum)

how to connect
create a IT account on the bank site
link to Sentinel
then IT account can login to Sentinel with IAM (must use IAM)
gets api key
append all users IT and above the API key in their IAM account so they can access the logs of the app

only executive can view the roles but roles should not be touched.

all iam users have a registered api key

maybe i should register Sentinel user and let them choose the api key

so employee role should be able to access the dashboard given the api key that they are connected to

developer role gets an api key

NOTE rmb to update the ganache transaction address and user address
